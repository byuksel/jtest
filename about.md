Machine Learning Fish is a fun and brief introduction to machine learning. 

### Story ###

These tutorials grew organically as a reference material to my machine learning workshops at numerous colleges (MIT, Yale, Princeton, etc) and hackathons. I would like to extend my gratitude of all the students who had the patience and the ear to learn the material while helping to distill it into its current state.

### Goal ###

My goal is to help introduce many to the wonders of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
